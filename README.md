# Radio Management Panel for your HomeCockpit
Radio Management Panel for HomeCockpit Use

This Repository shows the requred sources to build a A350ish Radio Management Panel for the use with your Home Flightsimulator. Currently it only works with X-Plane (FF320, ToLiss321, FF350) but MSFS compatibility is generally possible. 

You need the following: 
1. 3D Model
2. Electronic
3. Some Code

The requirements are described in more detail in the following chapters

## 3D Model
The components for the 3D Modell are available as STL to be printed by the 3DPrinter of your choice. The Frontplate is hosted externally but the other (fitting) elements are in the corresponding folder in this repository. 

### Front Plate
As Front Plate I found following freely available Model on thingyverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892991

### Back Plate
To fit the electronics (Buttons, Display etc.)I created a Backplate with holds that stuff and is mouted directly beneath the FrontPlate

### Buttons
