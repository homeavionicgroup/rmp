# Ingredients 


## 3D Model
The components for the 3D Modell are available as STL to be printed by the 3DPrinter of your choice. The Frontplate is hosted externally but the other (fitting) elements are in the corresponding folder in this repository. 

### Front Plate
As Front Plate I found following available Model on thingyverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2892991 and adapted it to fit it better with the buttons and the backplate. Checkout russ1364 model portfolio on thingyverse. He has some amazing stuff available if you look for Airbus specific material. 

### Back Plate
To fit the electronics (Buttons, Display etc.)I created a Backplate with holds that stuff and is mouted directly beneath the FrontPlate

### Buttons
You need Buttons in following numbers:
- 21 x Radiopanel-Button-big
- 3 x Radiopanel-Button-round (Big Dot)
- 3 x Radiopanel-Button-small (BAR)
- 2 x Radiopanel-Button-small (up)
- 1 each of (Radiopanel-Button-round (0-9),Radiopanel-Button-round (CLR), Radiopanel-Button-round (Dot), Radiopanel-Button-small (MSGCLR), Radiopanel-Button-small (RST)9


## Electronics

### Elements
You need following eletronics:
- 1 x Raspberry Pi 3 A+ 
- 1 x Waveshare 4.3 inch Touch Display with DSI Interface
- 1 x Raspberry Pico
- 43 x Omron B3F-4030
- 2 x KY-040 Rotary Encoders
- Lots of kables & Soldering equipment
- 1x short Micro USB cable to connect the Pico (20mm)
- 1x Micro USB cable with sufficient length (depending on where your USB Power Source is)

## Other
To hold everything together I use M4 screws with minimum of 30mm length incl. lots of washers and nuts. As to keep the elecontrics (especially the buttons and rotaries) in place, I use double-sided adhesive pads. For a less chaos I additionally use cable labeles, which makes the wiring a lot easier.
